# JuicyClient
(Client Work) Old MC Client that was never finished but demonstrates simple examples of basic client principles.

# What was this? 
This code is around 2 years old and I have learned a lot about the ins-and-outs of working with positioning, graphics, math, etc. This was a client project that fell out due to loss of interest from client. This was only around 20% finished but still contains lots of code on how to create mods, implement events, etc. The Minecraft source code is not on here for obvious reasons, but some code won't fully make sense for that reason.
